h1. What is Webbsuccé and why?

Our purpose is summarized in following values. We refer to this as "our home" or "our house".

It hangs on the wall in our office, and we bring it to our conferences so it can be easily updated. Here's what it says:

*Webbsuccé is a home for consultants who value:*
    
* *Live openess* - Will be open to any thing like, new oportunities, ideas, learn new things. Not be restricted
* *Be humble* - In our core we care for our self, each other, society and mother earth
* *Create freedom* - Freedom to execute live openess and to control our own time
    
We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).
