h1. Office team

We have an office team of 2 persons from our consultants dedicating part of their time. This change every six months. It is of course optional. The board takes the decision.

Things like:
* Client invoicing and payment followup.
* Office management (making sure new people have keys, organizing cleaning, ordering books, buy furniture and course materials, etc).
* Organize the bi-annual "Webbsucc√© unconference":unconference.html.

These are just a few examples, not a complete list.

Over time the intention is to hire a part time Office staff as contractor.
