	        <h1>Board of directors</h1>
<p>Being a Swedish company, we are required to have a board of directors. In most companies, the board is appointed by the owners to represent them so that the management group, headed by the <span class="caps">CEO</span>, runs the company according to the directives from the owners and the board.</p>
<p>At Webbsuccé, this works a little differently. First of all, <a href="ownership-model.html">we invite all Wembers to become owners after 1 year</a>, and second, we hold a yearly election of the board members where all Wembers (owners or not) have the right to vote.</p>
<h2>What does the board do?</h2>
<p>The board have monthly board meetings. The most important responsibilities are to make sure the financial aspect of Webbsuccé is OK and that the Wembers and the <a href="office-team.html">office team</a> are happy. The meetings are open for any Wembers to attend if they wish.</p>
<p>Managing the finances involves keeping an eye on the liquidity to be able to do day-to-day business and to aim for a zero result at the end of the fiscal year. See <a href="economic-model.html">Economic Model</a> for details.</p>
<p>If there is any Wember with a low score on <a href="happiness-index.html">Happiness Index</a>, a board members takes it upon themselves to call that person and to try and find out what can be done to make the Wember happier.</p>
<p>This is the template for our monthly board meetings.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Election of meeting secretary, chairman and attestant</li>
	<li>Schedule next meeting</li>
	<li>Information round</li>
	<li>Walk-through of previous protocol and action points</li>
	<li>Walk-through of economy</li>
	<li>Walk-through of <a href="happiness-index.html">Happiness Index</a>
	<ul>
		<li>The board creates action points to call any Wembers that have a low score on Happiness Index.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Important calendar events</li>
	<li>Free topics
	<ul>
		<li>Topic suggestions on post-it notes</li>
		<li>Prioritization</li>
		<li>Work through the topics</li>
	</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>How do we elect the board?</h2>
<p>We elect the board annually at the <a href="unconference.html">Webbsuccé Unconference</a> in the fall. Our board consists of four people</p>
<ol>
	<li>Chairman</li>
	<li>Board member 1</li>
	<li>Board member 2</li>
	<li>Board alternate</li>
</ol>
<h3>The current election process</h3>
<p>Before the election starts, Wembers who volunteer to run for the board of directors put their name up for consideration on a dedicated wall somewhere.</p>
<p>When it is time for the election, all Wembers gather in a circle. One of the Unconference facilitators manages the election process, where we elect one member at a time, in the order listed above, using closed voting and relative majority.</p>
<p>For each position on the board:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Any Weember may nominate any Wember.</li>
	<li>Nominees who accept the nomination are given the opportunity to offer a short motivation for why to vote for them.</li>
	<li>Each Wember casts a vote by writing the name of their favourite candidate on a piece of paper, and putting it in a basket in the middle of the circle.</li>
	<li>When everyone has voted, 2-3 people count the votes in front of the group. The candidate with the largest number of votes is announced the winner without further ado.</li>
</ol>
<p>We repeat this process until all four positions are filled.</p>
<p>Since we vote for one position at a time, we have the possibility to vote for a strong team. Let&#8217;s say the chairman is an intuitive agile coach, then, maybe, people will vote for a thoughtful programmer in the next round to balance the team.<br />
Past practice that has emerged, the board usually consist of one from our office staff, one programmer and one agile coach.</p>
